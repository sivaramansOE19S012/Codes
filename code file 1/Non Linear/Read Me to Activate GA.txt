Requird Inputs to activae Genetic Algorithm


X 					= input vectors in np.array 
Y 					= output vectors in np.array
population_size 			= number of data you have
selection_size  			= As our wish - (subject to optimazation)
max_generations 			= As our wish (based on convergence)
probability_of_individual_mutating 	= As of our wish((subject to optimization) #say 0.1
probability_of_gene_mutating 		= As of our wish((subject to optimization) # say 0.25
Acc					= expected Co-efficient of determination(subject to selection)

Outputs:

ans['COD'] 			= Coefficient of determination
ans['error']			= Mean Square Error
ans['coeff']			= Parameters
